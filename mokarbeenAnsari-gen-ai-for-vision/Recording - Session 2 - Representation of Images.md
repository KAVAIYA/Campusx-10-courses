# Basics of Pixels

- **Images are represented by a grid/array of pixels.**
  - An image is essentially a collection of tiny dots called pixels, arranged in rows and columns to form a grid. 

- **Each pixel stores color information.**
  - A pixel can represent different colors, and this color information is typically encoded in RGB (Red, Green, Blue) values.

- **The number of pixels defines the resolution of the image.**
  - Resolution is determined by the total number of pixels in the image. Higher resolution means more pixels, resulting in finer detail and clarity.

### Visual Representation

```
Resolution: 4x4 pixels
+---+---+---+---+
| P | P | P | P |
+---+---+---+---+
| P | P | P | P |
+---+---+---+---+
| P | P | P | P |
+---+---+---+---+
| P | P | P | P |
+---+---+---+---+
```
Where each "P" represents a pixel, which stores color information. The higher the number of rows and columns, the higher the resolution.

# Basics of RGB.

- **RGB stands for Red, Green, and Blue.**
  - These are the three primary colors of light used in digital displays and imaging.

- **Color Mixing:**
  - By combining different intensities of red, green, and blue light, a wide spectrum of colors can be created. This process is known as additive color mixing.

- **Color Representation:**
  - Each color is represented by a combination of red, green, and blue values. These values typically range from 0 to 255 in an 8-bit color depth system.
    - **0, 0, 0** represents black.
    - **255, 255, 255** represents white.
    - **255, 0, 0** represents pure red.
    - **0, 255, 0** represents pure green.
    - **0, 0, 255** represents pure blue.
  
- **Color Depth:**
  - The number of bits used to represent the color of a single pixel. More bits allow for more colors. For example:
    - 8-bit per channel (24-bit color) provides 16,777,216 possible colors.

- **Examples of RGB Combinations:**
  - **255, 255, 0** (Yellow)
  - **0, 255, 255** (Cyan)
  - **255, 0, 255** (Magenta)

---
### Visual Representation

Here’s how RGB values can mix to create different colors:

```
Red + Green = Yellow
(255, 0, 0) + (0, 255, 0) = (255, 255, 0)

Red + Blue = Magenta
(255, 0, 0) + (0, 0, 255) = (255, 0, 255)

Green + Blue = Cyan
(0, 255, 0) + (0, 0, 255) = (0, 255, 255)
```

By adjusting the intensity of each RGB component, various colors can be created for digital imaging and display purposes.

# Basics of RGB and Image File Formats

## RGB Color Model

- **RGB stands for Red, Green, and Blue.**

# Basics of channels.
# Basics of Channels in Digital Images

## What Are Channels?

- **Channels:** Channels in digital images refer to separate layers of color information that together create the final image. Each channel corresponds to a primary color component.
  
## RGB Channels

- **Red Channel:**

- **Green Channel:**
  - Stores the intensity of green light.
  - Higher values indicate more green color in the pixel.

- **Blue Channel:**
  - Stores the intensity of blue light.
  - Higher values indicate more blue color in the pixel.

### Example: RGB Channel Values
For a pixel with RGB value (R=200, G=150, B=100):
- **Red Channel:** 200
- **Green Channel:** 150
- **Blue Channel:** 100

## Additional Channels

# What is noise?

# Understanding Noise in Digital Images

## What is Noise?

- **Definition:** Noise in digital images refers to random variations of brightness or color information. It is unwanted information that can obscure or distort the visual quality of an image.

## Types of Noise

1. **Gaussian Noise:**
   - **Description:** Also known as normal noise, this type is characterized by variations that follow a Gaussian distribution.
   - **Appearance:** Looks like grainy or speckled patterns spread across the image.
   - **Cause:** Often results from electronic circuit noise or poor lighting conditions.

2. **Salt-and-Pepper Noise:**
   - **Description:** Also called impulse noise, it appears as random occurrences of black and white pixels.
   - **Appearance:** Resembles scattered salt and pepper grains.
   - **Cause:** Typically caused by faulty camera sensors, transmission errors, or analog-to-digital conversion issues.

3. **Poisson Noise:**
   - **Description:** Also known as shot noise, it is related to the discrete nature of light and the statistical fluctuations in the number of photons captured.
   - **Appearance:** Visible more in low-light conditions, it appears as random fluctuations.
   - **Cause:** Intrinsic to the photon-counting process in image sensors.

4. **Speckle Noise:**
   - **Description:** Common in coherent imaging systems such as laser, SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar), and ultrasound images.
   - **Appearance:** Looks like grainy noise that may affect the whole image or certain regions.
   - **Cause:** Interference caused by coherent waves reflected from rough surfaces.

## Causes of Noise

- **Electronic Noise:** Interference from electronic components in the imaging device.
- **Low Light Conditions:** Higher ISO settings increase sensitivity but also amplify noise.
- **High Temperature:** Thermal noise from the camera sensor when it heats up.
- **Transmission Errors:** Errors during the transfer of image data.

## Effects of Noise

- **Reduced Image Quality:** Noise can obscure details and make the image look grainy or distorted.
- **Loss of Information:** Important details may be lost or misrepresented.
- **Increased File Size:** Noise can increase the complexity of the image, leading to larger file sizes.

## Noise Reduction Techniques

1. **Filtering:**
   - **Mean Filter:** Reduces noise by averaging the pixel values in a neighborhood.
   - **Median Filter:** Reduces salt-and-pepper noise by replacing each pixel with the median value of neighboring pixels.
   - **Gaussian Filter:** Uses a Gaussian function to smooth the image and reduce Gaussian noise.

2. **Wavelet Transform:**
   - Decomposes the image into different frequency components and suppresses the noisy components.

3. **Non-Local Means (NLM):**
   - Averages similar pixel values in a large search window, providing better noise reduction while preserving edges.

4. **Adaptive Filtering:**
   - Adjusts the filter parameters based on the local image characteristics.

5. **Deep Learning:**
   - Using neural networks trained on large datasets to automatically learn and reduce noise patterns.
